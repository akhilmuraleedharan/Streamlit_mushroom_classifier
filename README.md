# Streamlit_mushroom_classifier

This repository is intended to be a guideline to create a Streamlit app for evaluating different classifiers. The web app enables the user to vary different hyperparameters and find the effect on the different evaluation metrics. Anyone who uses this webapp need not understand the code behind the classifier but can understand the effect of different parameters on the results that is obtained from the classifiers used.
